<p style="text-indent: 40px">Peter the Great attempted to westernize Russia, requiring people to cut off their beards and wear western European garments, as he had traveled to Europe and liked their dress. Those who did not comply were taxed. Peter also modernized education. He did this to create an army that could be feared throughout Europe, so in 1707 he created a school of medicine, in 1712 he made a school for engineering, and in 1724 he opened a school for science. He also encouraged young noblemen to travel through Europe and to learn the latest technology and economic theory. He believed that this widening of knowledge was not a threat but rather a benefit to Russia (C.N).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Vladimir Putin also sought to reform Russia society by trying to shift it back to a communist society. He has invested more money than the U.S. into the military (luhn). He also maintains control by switching between president and Prime  every four years (Vladimir). he also has created a constitutional government but without constitutional order or a balance of power (sakwa).
