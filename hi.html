<h1>Leadership</h1>
<h2>
    Peter was a ruler whose leadership caused several military reforms. One of the reforms was the creation of the Russian navy and the separation of church and state. He also abolished slavery so he could tax more people (Peter). Altogether he led Russia towards a new era and completed a final push when he stopped the tradition of having the eldest son be the heir (Peter).  When Peter died he had not named an heir to his wife inherited the power which led to over a century of female rule for Russia(Peter). Overall peter the great was an absolute monarch that led Russia to a new era.
