<p style="text-indent: 40px">Peter the Great attempted to westernize Russia, requiring people to cut off their beards and wear western European garments, as he had traveled to Europe and liked their dress. Those who did not comply were taxed. Peter also modernised education. He did this to create an army that could be feared throughout Europe, so in 1707 he created a school of medicine, in 1712 he made a school for engineering, and in 1724 he opened a school for science(C.N). He also encouraged young noblemen too travel through Europe and to learn the latest technology and economic therory. He belived that this widening of knowledge was not a threat but rather a benifit to Russia.</p>
