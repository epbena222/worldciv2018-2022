    In order to fund the war with Sweden, Peter created several taxes, such as the beard tax; those who would not shave their beards were taxed, to the soul tax, paid by all working age males. While he abolished slavery, previous slaves were serfs, who had to pay taxes. The war on Swedenâ€™s goal was to capture the Baltic Sea so Russia would have access to a warm water port for trade.
