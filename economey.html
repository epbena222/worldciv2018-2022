<p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to fund the war with Sweden, Peter created several taxes, examples of these taxes are: the beard tax, those who would not shave their beards were taxed, the soul tax, paid by all working age males with the exeption of clergy and noblity with traditionalists paying double(c.n). And to generate more revenue he abolished slavery, thereby makeing slaves into peasant serfs, who had to pay the soul tax. The purpose of the war with sweden was to seize the baltic sea so Russia would have access to a warm water port for trade. Under Peters leadership Russia won the war against Sweden. This allowed for trade with other countries wich bolstered Russia's economy.</p>
