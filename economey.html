<p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to fund the war with Sweden, Peter created several taxes, examples of these taxes are: the beard tax, those who would not shave their beards were taxed, the soul tax, paid by all working age males with the exception of clergy and nobility, with Traditionalists paying double(c.n). To generate more revenue, he abolished slavery thereby making slaves into peasant serfs, whom had to pay the soul tax. The purpose of the war with Sweden was to seize the Baltic Sea, so that Russia would have access to a warm water port for trade. Under Peter's leadership, Russia won the war against Sweden. This allowed for trade with other countries which bolstered Russia's economy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Putin has had an overall positive influence over Russia’s economy and quality of life; the GDP per capita of Russia before Putin’s election was $9,889, and as of January 2018 has reached $27,900. In 2000, Russia had only $12 billion in reserves, while its public debt almost rivaled. Today, Russia has $356 billion in reserves, and its public debt is only 17.4% of its GDP. Despite economic hardships in 2008, and recession from 2014-2016, Russia’s economy has pushed through, showing economic success on Putin’s part.
